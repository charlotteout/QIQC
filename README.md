# QIQC
Repository of exercises of the course Quantum Information and Quantum Communication offered at Amsterdam University College. This course was offerd by QuSoft, a Dutch research center for quantum software. These exercises were intended as a gentle introduction to some well known quantum algorithms. My Bachelors Thesis was a collaboration with QuSoft, for which I also wrote code, which can be found in a dedicated repo.

## Introduction to Cirq and creation of OR gates
In the first exercise, we generate OR gates on different numbers of qubits

## Implementation of Deutsch-Josza algorithm and generation of GHZ state
In the second exercise, we implement the Deutsch-Josza algorithm and generate the GHZ state
