# Quantum Computing stuff
Repository of the code I have written using Quantum Simulators. The first two exercises are from the course Quantum Information and Quantum Communication offered at Amsterdam University College. This course was offerd by QuSoft, a Dutch research center for quantum software. These exercises were intended as a gentle introduction to some well known quantum algorithms. The latter is the code I have written for my Bachelors Thesis, the implementation of the Quantum Leader Election algorithm by Tani et al. This thesis was a collaboration with QuSoft as well. The code is written using the quantum software projectQ, developed by ETH Zurich. 

## Introduction to Cirq and creation of OR gates
In the first exercise, we generate OR gates on different numbers of qubits

## Implementation of Deutsch-Josza algorithm and generation of GHZ state
In the second exercise, we implement the Deutsch-Josza algorithm and generate the GHZ state

## Quantum Leader Election code implementation
